<h1 align = "center"> A little bit about me :)<h1>
<p>My name is Matheus Reis, i'm 19 years old and I started to code because of the OBI (Olimpíada Brasileira de Informática) when i was 15, having mine first access to the world of programming. After that, i was curious about the robotics competitions so i decided to participate of the OBR (Olimpíada Brasileira de Robótica) in the simulation type. Being part of a team and works on a big project like that have improved my social skills and my mental to fulfill deadlines and works with many new technologies. My team was the second one in the state phase and the twenty-fifth in the nacional phase in 2021. In 2022, i've participated of the LARC (Latin American Robotics Competition) and won the first place, being classified to an internacional competition, in Bordeaux, France. In 2023 the internacional competition has concluded and my team was in the sixteenth place. Being part of this two competitions of a higher level improved so far the skills that i won in the OBR, mading me the programmer that i am now<p>
